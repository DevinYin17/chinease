    <h2>Discover China</h2>
    <p>
      With China's reform and opening up, it has become the world's second largest economy, accounting for 16% of the world's total GDP. At the same time, China's e-commerce has become the benchmark for the world.
      <br/>
      As of 2017, China's e-commerce turnover has accounted for 40% of the world. Can really sit at home, buy all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>By the way, China is also the world's largest electronic payment to use the country. Especially in Hangzhou and Shenzhen, the two cities have gradually developed into a cashless city, just a cell phone can complete all the consumption of the day.</p>

      Chiese Food
      <div class="text">
        <p>China is rich in tourist attractions. Delicious foods are an attraction indispensable in a good tour. With a long history, unique features, numerous styles and exquisite cooking, Chinese cuisine is one important constituent part of Chinese culture. Chinese dishes are famous for color, aroma, taste, meaning and appearance.</p>

      Living in China
      <div class="text">
        <p>There is still this idea that when you move to China, you leave behind all things familiar, comfortable and ‘Western’. As a living, breathing China expat, I can tell you this just isn’t so.</p>
        <p>In fact, if you really wanted to, you could create your own little Western world here in the East, though I suggest a nice balance between that and the fantastic Chinese culture.</p>

      Online shopping
      <div class="text">
        <p>Ecommerce was not invented in China, but some might say it was perfected in China. With a massive online population of 751 million, China has the world’s biggest and fast-growing ecommerce market, with sales reaching $752 billion in 2016, accounting for roughly 13.8 percent of the country’s total retail sales.</p>
        <p>A series of online shopping events is scheduled throughout the year by various online shopping platforms. The extraordinary rise of ecommerce has also brought new opportunities to rural China.</p>
        <p class="hidden">In 2016, online business owners in rural villages reached 8.11 million, creating more than 20 million jobs.</p>

      Electronic payments
      <div class="text">
        <p>Again, this was not invented in China, but China now leads mobile and internet payments in terms of user numbers and seamless technology. Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay are leading the charge toward a cashless society. The two of them together enabled $2.9 trillion in Chinese digital payments in 2016. However, even though electronic payments have become an essential part of daily life in China, the country “has not left cash behind completely,” according to a report by the Financial Times (paywall).</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Alibaba promoted a “cashless week” event to encourage use of its payment services, causing the People’s Bank of China to send a notice to its regional offices, ordering them to tone down such promotions for fear of misleading customers and interfering “with the normal currency flow of the yuan.” Meanwhile, the central bank has released a new regulation that requires online payment companies to connect to a centralized clearinghouse by October 15.</p>

      High-speed railways
      <div class="text">
        <p>Though the technology originated in Japan and Europe, China now has the world’s largest high-speed rail network, covering more than 20,000 kilometers; it is expected to more than double to 45,000 kilometers by 2030.</p>
        <p>According to Reuters, China’s ability to build high-speed rail projects more cheaply than its competitors also granted the technology a central place in the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

      On-demand bikes
      <div class="text">
        <p>As we noted in March this year, China’s bike sharing — or, more accurately, on-demand bike rental — is a real Chinese innovation, and it continues to grow rapidly. In July, Ofo, one of China’s bike-sharing companies valued at around $2 billion (the other one is Mobike), announced a $700 million funding round from investors led by ecommerce giant Alibaba, Hony Capital, and CITIC Private Equity.</p>
        <p>On August 9, after launching its bikes in six overseas markets, including Singapore, the United States, and Britain, Ofo announced its expansion into Japan in cooperation with SoftBank, which will back the venture with $1 billion funding.</p>
